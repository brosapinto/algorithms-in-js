# Longest common subsequence problem

LCS is the probem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences. It differs from the longest common substring because, unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

## Applications

This kind of algorithm is widely used, amongst other things, in data comparison programs, such as the diff utility, and in revision control systems, such as Git for reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.

## Example

- LCS for input Sequences `ABCDGH` and `AEDFHR` is `ADH` of length 3.
- LCS for input Sequences `AGGTAB` and `GXTXAYB` is `GTAB` of length 4.
